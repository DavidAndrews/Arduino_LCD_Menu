Adruino_LCD_MENU README

Purpose: To shorten the time to get an Adriuno project running using a menuing system.

Getting Started: Open the Arduino_Menu_LCD.ino sketch in the Arduino IDE.  Upload the sketch.  In the serial window, send the following keys to control the menu:

u - move UP
d - move DOWN
s - Select a menu option
b - move back in the menu tree

The idea is that you can invoke the menu system when appropriate, and have the Menu code drive all the navigation by piping your hardware inputs into the appropriate call in MenuManager.  When a menu item is selected that has an action associated with it, the menu system calls your callback so you can accomplish whatever the menu item is supposed to do.

This library builds on top of the Liquid Crystal library for doing LCD output.  On a new system, you should verify that you can create simple outputs using the Liquid Crystal library first, then move to this library to do your menuing.

The built-in actions right now are:

Back - Add a menu item labled "Back" and pass it the MenuEntry_BackCallbackFunc pointer, and you now have a Back menu entry (in case you don't have a hardware back button)

BoolTrue/False - These set a boolean to true or false so you can have off/on functionality easily.  This callback needs some more thinking and work right now to provide user feedback that the option was selected.


In addition, there is a MenuIntHelper class that assists in taking an integer input and setting a value. (See MenuIntHelper.h)
