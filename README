Adruino_LCD_MENU README

Purpose: To shorten the time to get an Adriuno project running using a menuing
system.

Getting Started: Unpack archive as sketchbook/libraries/Arduino_LCD_Menu.  In
the Arduino IDE, Open Arduino_LCD_Menu from the Examples menu.  Upload the
sketch.  In the serial window, send the following keys to control the menu:

u - move UP
d - move DOWN
s - Select a menu option
b - move back in the menu tree

The idea is that you can invoke the menu system when appropriate, and have the
Menu code drive all the navigation by piping your hardware inputs into the
appropriate call in MenuManager.  When a menu item is selected that has an
action associated with it, the menu system calls your callback so you can
accomplish whatever the menu item is supposed to do.

This library builds on top of the Liquid Crystal library for doing LCD output.
On a new system, you should verify that you can create simple outputs using the
Liquid Crystal library first, then move to this library to do your menuing.

The built-in actions right now are:

Back - Add a menu item labled "Back" and pass it the MenuEntry_BackCallbackFunc
pointer, and you now have a Back menu entry (in case you don't have a hardware
back button)

BoolTrue/False - These set a boolean to true or false so you can have off/on
functionality easily.  This callback needs some more thinking and work right
now to provide user feedback that the option was selected.

In addition, there is a MenuIntHelper class that assists in taking an integer
input and setting a value. (See MenuIntHelper.h)
